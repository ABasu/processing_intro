A simple Processing app to generate _March of the Penguins_ Linux posters and wallpapers in a variety of sizes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to edit the source to tweak the following:
* To change the size of the output files, simply edit the canvas dimensions in pixels. 
* Change the output filename / directory
* Change the font. If the "Baskerville" font isn't in your system, change it to something that's available. 

Simply open the .pde in Processing, edit, and run.
